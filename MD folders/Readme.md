The application that I want to make may seem simple, but valuable. The main reason I want to create this app is to make it easier for friends to keep in contact. I've noticed now that I'm getting older, my friend group doesn't talk to each other everyday anymore like we used to because of jobs and some being students. Because of this, reaching out may seem inconvenient and maybe some may see it as disturbing the other. So to counter this effect, I would like to make an application that makes it easy for friends to connect without needing to feel like you can't.

How the application works:

You will have to make an account. After everyone has an account you can make a group and set the name of the group. The core feature is the “Im free” (temporary button name) button, and the notification system. When you press “im free”, everyone in that group will get notified that you are free and would like to do something. To make it more flexible, you can get a time pop up, similar to what you would do when you set an alarm. So the notification would still immediately notify the others, but with time you are free.  
When getting a notification, you get 3 options: “Free in 15 minutes”, “Free in 30 minutes”, “Free tonight”.

Example flow:

Friend goes Free now

Notification appears

You tap “Free in 30 min”

Status auto-expires
